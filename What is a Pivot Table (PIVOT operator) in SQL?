What is a Pivot Table (PIVOT operator) in SQL?
 A pivot table transforms rows into columns to summarize or reorganize data.
 Useful for reporting and data analysis.

 Example:

SELECT *
FROM (
  SELECT Department, Salary
  FROM Employee
) AS SourceTable
PIVOT (
  AVG(Salary) FOR Department IN ([HR], [IT], [Finance])
) AS PivotTable;
