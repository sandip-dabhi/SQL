What is the difference between INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN?
These are types of joins used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

INNER JOIN:
Returns only the matching rows from both tables.
❗ Non-matching rows are excluded.

LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN):
Returns all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table.
If there’s no match, right-side columns will be NULL.

RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN):
Opposite of LEFT JOIN. Returns all rows from the right table and matching ones from the left.

FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN):
Returns all rows when there is a match in either table.
Missing matches will show NULL.
