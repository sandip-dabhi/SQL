What is a trigger in SQL?
A trigger is a stored procedure that automatically executes when a specific event occurs in the database.

Events include: INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE on a table.

Useful for auditing, logging, or enforcing business rules.

 Example:
CREATE TRIGGER before_insert_employee
BEFORE INSERT ON Employee
FOR EACH ROW
SET NEW.created_at = NOW();
