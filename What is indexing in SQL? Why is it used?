What is indexing in SQL? Why is it used?
An index is a database object used to speed up data retrieval operations on a table.

Think of it like a book index—it helps find data quickly without scanning the whole book.

Types:
Single-column index – on one column

Composite index – on multiple columns

Unique index – ensures all values are unique
