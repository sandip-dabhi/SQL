What is a UNIQUE constraint in SQL?
The UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column (or group of columns) are distinct.

Unlike PRIMARY KEY, a table can have multiple UNIQUE constraints, and columns can contain NULLs.

 Example:

CREATE TABLE Users (
  user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);
