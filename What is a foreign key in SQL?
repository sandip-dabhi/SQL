What is a foreign key in SQL?
A foreign key is a column that links to the primary key of another table to create a relationship between the two.

Key points:
Ensures referential integrity

Prevents actions that would leave orphan records

Can be used to join tables in queries
Example:

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (emp_id) REFERENCES Employee(emp_id)
);
