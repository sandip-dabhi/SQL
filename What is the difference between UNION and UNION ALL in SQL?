What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL in SQL?
Both UNION and UNION ALL are used to combine the results of two or more SELECT queries, but they behave differently in terms of handling duplicates.

 UNION:
Combines results of two or more queries.

Removes duplicate records.

Slower because it performs an additional step to eliminate duplicates.

 UNION ALL:
Combines results of two or more queries.

Includes all records, even if they are duplicates.

Faster than UNION because it does not remove duplicates.

 Example:

SELECT name FROM Employees
UNION
SELECT name FROM Contractors;

SELECT name FROM Employees
UNION ALL
SELECT name FROM Contractors;
