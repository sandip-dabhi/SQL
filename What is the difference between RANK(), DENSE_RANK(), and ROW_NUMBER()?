What is the difference between RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), and ROW_NUMBER()?
ROW_NUMBER():

Assigns a unique sequential number to each row.

Does not handle ties → if two rows have the same value, they still get different row numbers.

Always increments by 1.

 RANK():

Assigns the same rank to tied rows (rows with the same value).

Skips rank numbers after ties → e.g., if two rows are rank 1, the next rank will be 3.

 DENSE_RANK():

Assigns the same rank to tied rows (like RANK).

Does NOT skip rank numbers → e.g., if two rows are rank 1, the next rank is 2.

 Example:

SELECT name, salary,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS row_num,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank_num,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dense_rank_num
FROM Employee;
