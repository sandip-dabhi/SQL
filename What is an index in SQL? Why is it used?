What is an index in SQL? Why is it used?
An index is a data structure used to quickly locate rows in a table without scanning the entire table.

Works like a book index â€“ helps you jump directly to relevant data.
Key points:
Improves query performance, especially with large tables.

Types of indexes:

Single-column index

Composite index (multiple columns)

Unique index (prevents duplicate values)

Downside: Slows down INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations due to index maintenance.

 Example:
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_name ON Employee(name);
