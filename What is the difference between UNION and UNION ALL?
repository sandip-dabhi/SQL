What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL?
UNION combines results of two queries and removes duplicates.

UNION ALL combines all results, including duplicates.
 Example:
SELECT name FROM Students
UNION
SELECT name FROM Teachers;
 Use UNION when you want only unique rows.
 Use UNION ALL when you want faster performance and don't care about duplicates.
