What is a view in SQL?
A view is a virtual table based on the result set of a SQL query.

It does not store data physically, only the SQL query is stored.

 Key points:
Helps in simplifying complex queries.

Improves security by restricting access to specific columns/rows.

Can be used to hide complexity and present a simpler interface.

 Example:

CREATE VIEW EmployeeView AS
SELECT emp_id, name
FROM Employee
WHERE active = 1;
