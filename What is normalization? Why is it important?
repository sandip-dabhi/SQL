What is normalization? Why is it important?
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

It breaks a large table into smaller related tables and uses keys to connect them.

Benefits:
Eliminates duplicate data

Reduces data anomalies (update, insert, delete)

Makes data more structured and efficient

Common Normal Forms:
1NF: Eliminate repeating groups; atomic values only.

2NF: Meet 1NF + remove partial dependencies.

3NF: Meet 2NF + remove transitive dependencies.

Normalization helps maintain a clean, efficient schema in relational databases.
