What is a Recursive Query?
 A recursive query calls itself to fetch hierarchical data (e.g., org charts, folder structures).
 Typically uses a CTE with RECURSIVE keyword.
 Example:

WITH RECURSIVE EmployeeHierarchy AS (
  SELECT id, name, manager_id FROM Employee WHERE manager_id IS NULL
  UNION ALL
  SELECT e.id, e.name, e.manager_id
  FROM Employee e
  JOIN EmployeeHierarchy eh ON e.manager_id = eh.id
)
SELECT * FROM EmployeeHierarchy;
