What is the difference between DELETE, TRUNCATE, and DROP?
1. DELETE
Used to remove specific rows from a table using a WHERE clause.

Can be rolled back (transaction-safe).

Does not remove the table structure.

Triggers ON DELETE events (if defined).

Slower compared to TRUNCATE and DROP (logs each row deletion).

 Example:
DELETE FROM Employee WHERE id = 5;

2. TRUNCATE
Used to remove all rows from a table (resets it).

Cannot be rolled back in most RDBMS (non-transactional).

Keeps the table structure and schema.

Resets identity/auto-increment values.

Faster than DELETE as it does not log individual row deletions.

 Example:
TRUNCATE TABLE Employee;

3. DROP
Used to remove the entire table, including its structure and data.

Cannot be rolled back (non-recoverable).

Completely removes table definition from the database.

Fastest of the three.

 Example:
DROP TABLE Employee;
