What is the difference between CROSS JOIN and INNER JOIN?
 CROSS JOIN returns cartesian product â†’ all possible row combinations between two tables.
 INNER JOIN returns only rows that satisfy a matching condition.

Example:
SELECT * FROM A CROSS JOIN B;
vs
SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON A.id = B.a_id;
