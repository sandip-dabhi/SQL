What is a Foreign Key in SQL?
A foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that refers to the primary key in another table.

It creates a relationship between two tables and enforces referential integrity.

 Key Points:

Ensures that values in the foreign key column must exist in the referenced primary key column.

Prevents invalid data insertion and maintains relational consistency.

 Example:

CREATE TABLE Department (
  dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  dept_name VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Employee (
  emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  emp_name VARCHAR(100),
  dept_id INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES Department(dept_id)
);
