What is a CASE Statement in SQL?
The CASE statement is SQLâ€™s way of adding conditional logic to queries.

Works like IF-ELSE in programming languages.

 Key Points:

Returns different values based on conditions.

Can be used in SELECT, ORDER BY, WHERE, etc.

 Example:

SELECT name, salary,
  CASE
    WHEN salary >= 100000 THEN 'High Earner'
    WHEN salary >= 50000 THEN 'Mid Earner'
    ELSE 'Low Earner'
  END AS salary_category
FROM Employee;
