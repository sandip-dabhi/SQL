What is a stored procedure in SQL?
A stored procedure is a precompiled block of SQL code stored in the database and can be reused.

 Benefits:
Improves performance (since it's precompiled)

Promotes reusability and modularity

Adds security and simplifies logic
 Example:

CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeByDept(IN deptName VARCHAR(50))
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE department = deptName;
END;
