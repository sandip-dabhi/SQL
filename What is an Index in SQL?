What is an Index in SQL?
An index is a database structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations.

 Key Points:

Works like an index in a book: helps locate data quickly.

Especially helpful on large tables and for columns used in WHERE, JOIN, or ORDER BY.

Too many indexes can slow down INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations due to maintenance overhead.

 Example:

CREATE INDEX idx_employee_name
ON Employee (name);
