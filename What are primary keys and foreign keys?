What are primary keys and foreign keys?
A Primary Key is a column (or combo of columns) that uniquely identifies each row in a table.

Cannot be null

Only one per table

A Foreign Key is a column that creates a relationship between two tables, referencing the primary key of another table.

Example:
Employee(emp_id PRIMARY KEY, dept_id)

Department(dept_id PRIMARY KEY)

Employee.dept_id is a foreign key referencing Department.dept_id

Primary Key = Identity
Foreign Key = Relationship
