What are Aggregate Functions in SQL?
Aggregate functions perform calculations on multiple rows of a table and return a single result.

 Common aggregate functions:

SUM() – Adds all values

AVG() – Calculates average

COUNT() – Counts rows

MAX() – Finds maximum

MIN() – Finds minimum

 Example:

SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total_employees, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM Employee
GROUP BY department;
