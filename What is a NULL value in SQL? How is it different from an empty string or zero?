What is a NULL value in SQL? How is it different from an empty string or zero?
A NULL value represents missing or unknown data in SQL.

 Key points:
NULL is not the same as an empty string ("") or zero (0).

NULL means no value has been assigned or is unknown.

NULL cannot be compared directly with other values using = or <>. Instead, use IS NULL or IS NOT NULL.

 Example:

SELECT name FROM Employees WHERE salary IS NULL;
