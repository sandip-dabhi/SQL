What is a Window Function in SQL?
A window function performs a calculation across a set of table rows that are related to the current row, without collapsing them into one row like GROUP BY.

 Key Points:

Uses the OVER() clause to define a "window" of rows.

Common functions: ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), SUM(), AVG() over a window.

 Example:

SELECT name, department, salary,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dept_rank
FROM Employee;
