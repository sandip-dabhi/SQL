What is denormalization?
Denormalization is the opposite of normalization: combining tables to improve read performance.

Used in systems where fast retrieval is more important than update efficiency (e.g., reporting, data warehousing).

 Key points:
Reduces number of joins

Can lead to data redundancy

Often used with indexing and caching to improve performance
