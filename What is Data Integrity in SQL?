What is Data Integrity in SQL?
Data integrity ensures the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data in a database.

 Types:

Entity Integrity → enforced by primary keys.

Referential Integrity → enforced by foreign keys.

Domain Integrity → enforced by data types, constraints (CHECK, NOT NULL).

 Example:

A foreign key constraint prevents assigning a department ID that doesn’t exist in the Department table.
