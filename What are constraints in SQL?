What are constraints in SQL?
Constraints are rules enforced on data columns to ensure data accuracy and integrity.

 Common types of constraints:
PRIMARY KEY: Ensures each record is unique and not NULL.

FOREIGN KEY: Enforces a relationship between tables.

UNIQUE: Ensures all values in a column are different.

NOT NULL: Ensures a column cannot have NULL values.

CHECK: Limits the range of values a column can accept.

DEFAULT: Sets a default value for a column when no value is specified.

 Example:
CREATE TABLE Employee (
  emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  salary INT CHECK (salary > 0)
);
