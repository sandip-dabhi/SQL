What are the ACID properties in SQL databases? Why are they important?
ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability â€“ the four key properties that ensure reliable and secure database transactions.

ðŸ”¹ Atomicity

A transaction is all or nothing.

If one part fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.
 Example: Money transfer between two accounts â€“ both debit and credit must succeed.

ðŸ”¹ Consistency

The database must go from one valid state to another valid state.

All rules, constraints, and data types must remain valid.
 Example: A foreign key constraint shouldn't be violated after a transaction.

ðŸ”¹ Isolation

Transactions must not interfere with each other.

Results of one transaction should not be visible to others until it's complete.
 Example: If two people try to book the same movie ticket at once, only one should succeed.

ðŸ”¹ Durability

Once a transaction is committed, the changes are permanent â€“ even if the system crashes afterward.
 Example: After booking a ticket, the booking record must stay safe.

Why it matters:
ACID ensures data integrity, accuracy, and reliability, especially in multi-user and critical systems like banking or inventory management.
