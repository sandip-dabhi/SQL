What is a transaction in SQL?
A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL operations executed as a single unit.

Ensures data integrity and consistency.

Follows the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).

Transactions are managed using:

BEGIN or START TRANSACTION

COMMIT (to save changes)

ROLLBACK (to undo changes)

 Example:

START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE Account SET balance = balance - 1000 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE Account SET balance = balance + 1000 WHERE id = 2;
COMMIT;
