What is a Composite Primary Key?
A composite primary key is a primary key made up of two or more columns.

Ensures uniqueness based on the combination of values, not a single column alone.

 Key points:

Used when one column alone cannot uniquely identify a row.

All columns in the composite key must be NOT NULL.

 Example:

CREATE TABLE Enrollment (
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    enrollment_date DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id)
);
