What is a Self Join in SQL?
A self join is a regular join where a table is joined with itself.

Used when rows in the same table are related to each other.

 Key points:

You must use table aliases to differentiate the table copies.

Common for hierarchical or relationship data (like managers and employees).

 Example:

SELECT A.name AS Employee, B.name AS Manager
FROM Employee A
LEFT JOIN Employee B
ON A.manager_id = B.emp_id;
