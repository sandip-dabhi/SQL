What is the difference between GROUP BY and ORDER BY in SQL?
 GROUP BY:
Used to group rows that have the same values into summary rows, like aggregating data (e.g., COUNT, AVG).

Often used with aggregate functions like SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX.

 ORDER BY:
Used to sort the result set based on one or more columns.

Allows ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) sorting.

 Key Differences:
GROUP BY groups rows based on column values.

ORDER BY sorts the entire result set after it is processed.

 Example:

SELECT department, COUNT(*) FROM Employees
GROUP BY department
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
