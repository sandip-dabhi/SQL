 What is a CTE (Common Table Expression) in SQL?
A CTE is a temporary named result set you can reference within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE query.

 Key points:

Makes complex queries easier to read and organize.

Defined using the WITH keyword.

Can be recursive (CTE that refers to itself).

 Example:

WITH TopEmployees AS (
    SELECT name, salary
    FROM Employee
    WHERE salary > 100000
)
SELECT * FROM TopEmployees;
