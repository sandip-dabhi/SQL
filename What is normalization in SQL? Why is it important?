What is normalization in SQL? Why is it important?
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

It breaks down large tables into smaller related tables.

 Key benefits:
Avoids duplicate data

Ensures consistency

Makes updates more efficient

 Common Normal Forms:
1NF (First Normal Form) – No repeating groups or arrays

2NF (Second Normal Form) – 1NF + no partial dependency

3NF (Third Normal Form) – 2NF + no transitive dependency
