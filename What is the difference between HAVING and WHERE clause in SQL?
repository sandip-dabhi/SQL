What is the difference between HAVING and WHERE clause in SQL?
 WHERE:

Filters rows before any grouping or aggregation.

Cannot be used with aggregate functions like SUM(), COUNT(), etc.

 HAVING:

Filters groups after aggregation has been performed.

Used with GROUP BY and aggregate functions.

 Example:

-- WHERE filters before grouping
SELECT department, salary
FROM Employee
WHERE salary > 50000;

-- HAVING filters after grouping
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS emp_count
FROM Employee
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
