What is a subquery in SQL? What are its types?
A subquery is a query nested inside another query, used to return data that will be used by the main query.

 Example:

SELECT name
FROM Employee
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Employee);
This returns employees who earn more than the average salary.

Types of subqueries:
Single-row subquery – returns only one row
→ Used with operators like =, <, >

Multi-row subquery – returns multiple rows
→ Used with IN, ANY, ALL

Correlated subquery – references columns from the outer query and runs once per row
→ Slower, but powerful for row-wise comparisons

 Correlated subquery example:

SELECT e1.name
FROM Employee e1
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Employee e2 WHERE e1.department = e2.department);
