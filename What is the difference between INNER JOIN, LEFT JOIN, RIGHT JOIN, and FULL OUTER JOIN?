What is the difference between INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN?
ðŸ”¹ INNER JOIN
Returns rows that match in both tables

ðŸ”¹ LEFT JOIN
Returns all rows from the left table + matching rows from the right (NULL if no match)

ðŸ”¹ RIGHT JOIN
Returns all rows from the right table + matching rows from the left (NULL if no match)

ðŸ”¹ FULL OUTER JOIN
Returns all rows from both tables (NULL if no match on either side)

 Example:
SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON A.id = B.id;
SELECT * FROM A LEFT JOIN B ON A.id = B.id;
SELECT * FROM A RIGHT JOIN B ON A.id = B.id;
SELECT * FROM A FULL OUTER JOIN B ON A.id = B.id;
