What is a subquery in SQL?
A subquery is a query inside another query.

It is used to fetch data that will be used by the main (outer) query.

Can be placed in SELECT, FROM, or WHERE clauses.

 Types of Subqueries:
Single-row subquery: Returns only one row.

Multi-row subquery: Returns multiple rows.

Correlated subquery: Depends on the outer query for its value.

 Key points:
Helps break complex queries into smaller parts.

Useful for filtering, comparison, and calculation.

 Example (Subquery in WHERE clause):

SELECT name 
FROM Employee 
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Employee);
