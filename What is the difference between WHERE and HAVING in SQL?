What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING in SQL?
WHERE is used to filter rows before grouping (works on raw rows).

HAVING is used to filter groups after aggregation (like GROUP BY).

Example:

-- Filters rows before grouping
SELECT department, COUNT(*) 
FROM Employee
WHERE salary > 30000 
GROUP BY department;

-- Filters grouped results
SELECT department, COUNT(*) 
FROM Employee
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
 Use WHERE for row-level filters and HAVING for group-level filters.
