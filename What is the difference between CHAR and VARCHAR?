What is the difference between CHAR and VARCHAR?

CHAR(n)
Stores fixed-length character strings.

If the data is shorter than n, it pads the remaining space with spaces.

Always occupies n bytes, regardless of actual string length.

Slightly faster in performance because of fixed size.

Ideal for data with known/constant length, like postal codes, country codes, etc.

 Example:

CHAR(10)

VARCHAR(n)
Stores variable-length character strings.

Only stores as many characters as neededâ€”no padding.

Occupies 1 to n bytes, depending on string length (plus 1 or 2 extra bytes for length info).

More space-efficient, especially for large datasets with variable-length data.

Ideal for names, addresses, descriptions, etc.

 Example:

VARCHAR(10)
