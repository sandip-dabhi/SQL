What is a view in SQL? Why use it?
A view is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL query. It doesn't store data itself but pulls it from one or more tables.

 Why use views?
Simplify complex queries

Improve security (restrict access to certain columns)

Provide a consistent interface even if the underlying schema changes

 Syntax:

CREATE VIEW HighSalaryEmployees AS
SELECT name, salary FROM Employee WHERE salary > 50000;
